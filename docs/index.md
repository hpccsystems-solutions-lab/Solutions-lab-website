# Learn ECL

Our HPCC Systems Solutions Lab is proud to provide and support ECL tutorials.

Here we introduce basics of HPCC Systems, our big data platform, and a complete tutorial on ECL (Enterprise Control Language).

# Introduction

## HPCC Systems: End to End Data Lake Management

HPCC Systems is a mature platform that has been heavily used in commercial applications for almost two decades, predating the development of Hadoop. Created by LexisNexis® Risk Solutions, an innovative pioneer in big data processing, and open source for nearly a decade now, HPCC Systems features a vibrant development community that continues to push the boundaries of big data.\
This powerful, versatile platform makes it easier for developers to see the data they’re working with and manipulate it as needed. Flexible information delivery makes it easier for your clients to query and find the data they need — and it runs analysis and queries faster than other platforms such as SQL or Hadoop.\

**Key Functionalities:**

- Standard hardware, operating system and protocols
- High redundancy and availability
- Practical tools and extensions
- Efficient programming
- End-to-end configuration
- Optimized distributed file system (dfs)
- Massive scalability and performance

  # ECL

  ECL is an easy-to-learn, advanced, and flexible declarative language that was initially developed for complex data scenarios more than 20 years ago and has been tested and refined continuously ever since.\
  ECL has been designed specifically for massive data projects using the LexisNexis Risk Solutions HPCC Systems platform. ECL's extreme scalability comes from a design that allows you to leverage every query you create for re-use in subsequent queries as needed.

* Not case sensitive
* Declarative Programming Language
  - In declarative programming you specifies what is to be done rather than how to do it.
* Can perform on any Cluster Size
* Source-to-source compiler
* ECL code translated to C++ that is compiled to shared libraries and executed within a custom frame-work
* One line comment
  - `//one line only`
* Block comment
  - `/* this is a block comment*/`
* Use of object.property to access dataset fields and definitions.
  - `dataset.fieldName`
  - `moduleName.definition`

### Two Statement Types

**Definition\Expression**

Assign an expression to an attribute. Definitions are evaluated.\
Definitions always contain `:=`

`STRING def := 'this is a definition';`\
`INTEGER Num := 900;`

**Action**
Action simple means "do something." Actions trigger execution of a workunit that produces
results.

`OUTPUT('this is an action');`\
`SUM(1,2)`

```java
// A simple program

//defining an attribute
str := 'Hello Word';

//puting it into action
OUTPUT(str, NAMED('My_First_Program'));

//Defining an action
NumOne := MAX(1,2,5,6);

//Actionizing it
OUTPUT(NumOne, NAMED('ActionThis'));

//Pretty simple actions, followings produce result
'my first ECL code';
1 + 4 + 5;
2 * 3;

```

## ECL Cloud IDE
